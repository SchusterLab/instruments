# instruments

## How to Use

There are two ways to install this instrument driver collection.

### 1. from github

do: `pip install git+git://github.com/SchusterLab/instruments.git@master`

### 2. from pip

do `pip install instruments`


## To Contribute:

The benefit of building instrument drivers this way, is that it allows us to have a README for each driver, and a consistent testing convention.

To help fix bugs and create new drivers, and help make everyone's life easier in the lab, I ask you the following:

1. Always write tests for your code.
2. Write up the README nicely, so that the first-year in your lab knows how to use this.

Many thanks to you future contributors in advance!
